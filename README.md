# WeiChen-Academic
Research mainly focused on bio-inspired materials/devices for smart drug delivery and disease detection, especially for tumor and diabetes diagnostic and therapy. Dr. Chen has developed various formulations and devices, (1) prepared biomimetic mineralized drug formulation, which reversed tumor resistance; (2) successfully fabricated a glucose-responsive microneedle patch, which facilitated long-term management of patient blood glucose; (3) created ultra-strong bioadhesive microneedle-based tablets for efficient oral delivery of macromolecular drugs; (4) developed virus-concentrated microneedle oropharyngeal swabs, which improved the accuracy of COVID-19 detection. Dr. Chen has published lots of papers in high-quality journals including Sci. Adv. (2022), Nano Lett. (2022), Adv. Mater. (2021), Theranostics (2021)，Matter (2020), Nano today (2020), Nano Lett. (2019), Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. (2018), Nat. Commun. (2017), ACS nano (2017), Small (2014,2015), Journal Control. Release (2015), Nano Res. (2014)，Chem. Commun. (2013), and so on. Moreover, he has led four fundings and successfully applied for 2 patents. His work exhibited high translational potential in clinical application and draw increasing attention in both academic and industrial fields.
